Let's talk about user interfaces.

```notes
User interfaces are hard.

```notes
I don't know about you, but I have never seen a "Check Engine" light
and known unequivicablly what the issue was and whether it was serious.
This interface is horrible: ambiguous and vague.

Bad interfaces are everywhere. They exist in our physical devices and our
software, especially websites.

```notes
Then this happened. These interface problems only got worse with phones.
Our problem wasn't just clarity or precision, it was now also adaptability
and responsiveness. We had to account for screen size, network conditions,
device capability and more.

## Why use React?

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Declarative - simple views that react to changes in state</li>
    <li>Component-based - encapsulate your UI in tight, composable chunks</li>
    <li>Multiple render targets - render for browser, mobile native or VR</li>
    <li>Used by many companies, like: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Walmart and more</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
Declarative
Component-based
Multiple render targets

## How does it work?

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Virtual DOM</li>
    <li>JSX</li>
    <li>Props reflect configuration</li>
    <li>State reflects changing data</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
Virtual DOM
JSX
Props reflect configuration
State reflects changing data

Let's explore these a little more.

```notes
It's a lot to take in.

export default FullScreenCode

```jsx
// JSX
<Button text="Hello, World!">
  <p>How are you?</p>
</Button>

// JavaScript
React.createElement(
  Button,
  { text: 'Hello, World!' },
  React.createElement(
    'p',
    null,
    'How are you?'
  )
)
```

```notes
JSX example
```
---
export default FullScreenCode

```jsx
// Button.jsx
const Button = (props) => (
  <button className="magicbutton" onClick={props.onClick}>
    <h1>{props.heading}<h1>
    {props.children}
  </button>
)

// App.jsx
<Button heading="Hello, World!" onClick={startMagic}>
  <p>Start Magic!</p>
</Button>
```

```notes
Props example
```
---
export default FullScreenCode

```jsx
// Button.jsx
class Button extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { count: 0 }
  }
  addCount = () => {
    const count = this.state.count;
    this.setState({ count: count + 1 })
  }
  render() {
    return (<button onClick={this.addCount}>
      {this.props.label}: {this.state.count}
    </button>)
  }
}
```

```notes
State example
```

export default Split

```jsx
// App.jsx
<Button label="Clicks" />

<Button label="Clacks" />
```

<Button label="Clicks" />

<Button label="Clacks" />

How do we get started?

https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html

---

## Step 1: Add a container to HTML

```html
<body>
  <!-- snip -->
  <div id="like_button"></div>
  <!-- snip -->
</body>
```

```notes
Every component needs a container to mount to.

React can be added incrementally. You don't need a whole site written in it.

You can use a very small component to start and then branch out from there.
```
---

## Step 2: Add the Script Tags

```html
<head>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- snip -->
  <script src="like_button.js"></script>
</body>
```

```notes
Include React library.

Include ReactDOM script, because we are rendering to DOM.

Finally, include our component script.
```
---
export default FullScreenCode

```js
const e = React.createElement;
class LikeButton extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { liked: false };
  }
  render() {
    if (this.state.liked) { return 'You liked this.'; }
    return e('button',
      { onClick: () => this.setState({ liked: true }) },
      'Like');
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(e(LikeButton), document.querySelector('#like_button'));
```

```notes
Step 3: Create a React Component
```
---

Let's see it in action:

---

What if I want a React-powered website?

---

## Create React App

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app

# To work on your site and run it
npm start

# To create an optimized build
npm run build
```

```notes
It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production.
```

I use React and C# every day. Actually, we use React.net which allows us
to server render our React and pass C# classes and data right into our
components.
