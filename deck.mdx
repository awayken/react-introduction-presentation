User interfaces are hard.

```notes
Worst interface ever. It's a big error message with zero context, and it's often a false alarm.

## What is React?

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>"A JavaScript library for building user interfaces"</li>
    <li>Created and open sourced by Facebook in 2013</li>
    <li>112k+ Stars, 1.2k+ Contributors on <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/">facebook/react</a></li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---

## Why use React?

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Declarative - simple views that react to changes in state</li>
    <li>Component-based - encapsulate your UI in tight, composable chunks</li>
    <li>Multiple render targets - render for browser, mobile native or VR</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

## What does React code look like?

```js
class HelloMessage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>Hello, {this.props.name}</div>
    );
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloMessage name="Miles" />,
  rootEl
);
```
