Let's talk about user interfaces.

User interfaces are hard.

```notes
I don't know about you, but I have never seen a "Check Engine" light
and known unequivicablly what the issue was and whether it was serious.
This interface is horrible: ambiguous and vague.

Bad interfaces are everywhere. They exist in our physical devices and our
software, especially websites.

```notes
Then this happened. These interface problems only got worse with phones.
Our problem wasn't just clarity or precision, it was now also adaptability
and responsiveness. We had to account for screen size, network conditions,
device capability and more.

Perhaps apocryphal, but the source of frustration that became React.

## What is React?

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>"A JavaScript library for building user interfaces"</li>
    <li>Created and open sourced by Facebook in 2013</li>
    <li>112k+ Stars, 1.2k+ Contributors on <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/">facebook/react</a></li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---

## Why use React?

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Declarative - simple views that react to changes in state</li>
    <li>Component-based - encapsulate your UI in tight, composable chunks</li>
    <li>Multiple render targets - render for browser, mobile native or VR</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---

## How do we do this?

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Virtual DOM</li>
    <li>JSX</li>
    <li>Props reflect configuration</li>
    <li>State reflects changing data</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

export default FullScreenCode

```jsx
// JSX
<Button text="Hello, World!">
  <p>How are you?</p>
</Button>

// JavaScript
React.createElement(
  Button,
  { text: 'Hello, World!' },
  React.createElement(
    'p',
    null,
    'How are you?'
  )
)
```

```notes
JSX example
```
---
export default FullScreenCode

```jsx
// Button.jsx
const Button = (props) => (
  <button className="magicbutton" onClick={props.onClick}>
    <h1>{props.text}<h1>
    {props.children}
  </button>
)

// App.jsx
<Button heading="Hello, World!" onClick={startMagic}>
  <p>Start Magic!</p>
</Button>
```

```notes
Props example
```
---
export default FullScreenCode

```jsx
// Button.jsx
class Button extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { count: 0 }
  }
  addCount = () => {
    const count = this.state.count;
    this.setState({ count: count + 1 })
  }
  render() {
    return (<button onClick={this.addCount}>
      {this.props.label}: {this.state.count}
    </button>)
  }
}
```

```notes
State example

export default Split

```jsx
// App.jsx
<Button label="Clicks" />

<Button label="Clacks" />
```

<Button label="Clicks" />

<Button label="Clacks" />
